#### February 22, 2021{section=technical}

In this release, here is a list of technical changes that may require infrastructure or database updates, or represents additional functionality.

* Updated the DABS Review page to calculate Total Obligations from File C upon loading instead of when loading the page to improve on the page performance with larger submissions.
* Updated the DABS reporting schedule accounting for holidays.
* Both on the frontend and API users must publish and certify using only monthly submissions starting from FY22 on. All quarterly submissions from that point on will be automatically converted to test submissions.
