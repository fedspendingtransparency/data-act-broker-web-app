In this release of the Broker, we:

* Added the obligation amount to the DABS Error and Warning reports for validation rules C8/C9 and C11/C12. The amount of the transaction is now included in the `Source Value Provided` column as well as in the `Difference` column. This should assist agencies with prioritization based on materiality.
