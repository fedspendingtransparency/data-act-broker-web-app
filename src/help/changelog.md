#### April 19, 2021{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Fixed a bug in the process for generating File A where, in rare instances, an agency with a TAS assigned to them with an agency identifier of 011 would not get included in the File A generated by the Broker. All 011 TAS should now appear in the appropriate File A for the appropriate agency.
* Added V to list of valid Disaster Emergency Fund Codes (DEFC) and included it in the list of COVID-19 related DEFCâ€™s.
* Updated API documentation to provide full URL with the endpoint documentation.
* Fixed a few minor Front End display bugs.
