#### January 14, 2022{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated the Submission History page for Published/Certified submissions. In the Download Files section where users can click to download individual files that were included in each submission, we added a link to download all the files at the same time in a .zip file.
* Added a "Revalidate Submission" button on Steps 1 and 3 of the DABS Submission Workflow to allow users to intentionally run the validations again from the current page. In the event a user had encountered a critical error and now believes the error has been cleared, they will have the ability to run the set of validations on that page again without the need to start a new submission or have to delete and re-upload an agency file.
