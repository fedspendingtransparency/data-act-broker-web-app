#### October 5, 2020{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated DABS to identify and remove any Test submissions that have not been updated in over 6 months. After the initial removal, this process will run on a nightly basis. To prevent a submission from being removed, simply make an update to it (such as saving a comment) before the 6 monthsâ€™ time has elapsed. In addition, all uncertified FY17Q1 or before submissions will be removed as reporting was not required for that reporting time frame.
* Several bug fixes and performance enhancements.
