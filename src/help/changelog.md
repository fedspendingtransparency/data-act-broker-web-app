In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated logic for validation rule B20 to allow reporting periods prior to FY21 to be submitted, updated, and re-certified without requiring valid Program Activity Codes and Names in File C. Program Activity was optional in File C until the start of FY21 when it became a required field (per OMB Memo M-20-21).
