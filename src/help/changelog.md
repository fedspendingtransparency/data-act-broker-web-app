##### February 7, 2019
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated the Broker to implement the Federal Hierarchy validations and derivations described in DAIMS v1.3. Implemented a related one-time data enhancement that backfills office names from 10/1/2018 forward in FABS using provided office codes and the Federal Hierarchy.
* Updated the Broker File A Generation in DABS to be based on period rather than fiscal quarter (quarters can still be generated by selecting periods 03, 06, 09, and 12, so no functionality was lost).
* Updated Help section of the Broker to streamline it and reduce redundancies between it and the Fiscal Service DAIMS page (https://fiscal.treasury.gov/data-transparency/) and the Broker. 
* Various API documentation and error message improvements.
* Updated job file size limit and memory management to allow larger D1/D2 files to generate without issue.
* Various minor updates and improvements (Updated DABS Submission calendar document, Updated links to relaunched Fiscal Service Website, updated duplicate publication check to catch additional edge-case, improved special character handling in filenames and carriage return handling within data cells).
