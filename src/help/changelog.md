#### November 30, 2020{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated File C to make Program Activity Code and Program Activity Name required fields to comply with OMB Memo M-20-21.
* Updated logic in validations C20, C21, and C26 to now properly trigger these warnings and only return a difference on the warning report for those balances that fail the check.
