#### February 22, 2021{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated the Broker to comply with OMB Memo M-20-21 to require all agencies to submit monthly file sets beginning in FY22. For periods selected in FY22 and beyond, any new quarterly submission will only be able to be created as a Test submission.
* Enhanced the user interface in DABS for the Review & Publish page (step 5 of the workflow). We redesigned the Agency Comments section of the page to be more intuitive and more useful to users. Changes include:
    * Removing the single comment box and the drop list to choose which file to comment on and replacing with an individual box for each file. This enables users to see all their comments on page at the same time to facilitate review as well as make it clearer that separate comments can be provided for each file. 
    * The comment section is now collapsible.
    * We added a new Submission Comment box. This is to allow users to provide any overall comments or statements they feel are applicable to the submission as a whole. They can then limit the individual file comments to only comments pertaining specifically to that file. 
    * All Comment boxes now detect and warn users if they are including non-ASCII text which may affect the appearance of their comments on USAspending.gov.
    * The page will inform the user if there are unsaved comments on the page and will notify them if they attempt to leave the page with unsaved comments.
