#### July 16, 2024{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Slightly modified the look and feel of the Broker to have a higher contrast in accordance with Section 508 Compliance and Accessibility. This includes darker tables, slightly darker colors, underlined links in the bodies of text, and the error/warning counts style being updated.
* Updated GTAS BOC Comparison Page Description and Report to ignore 'non-X'/non-null PYAs from GTAS.
