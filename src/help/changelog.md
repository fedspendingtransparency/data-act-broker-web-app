##### February 25, 2019
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated FABS 39.3, FABS41.1 and FABS41.2 so that they allow for valid city codes in the ####R format. Updated FABS39.1 to properly implement the city-code format check, and to allow for ####R format to be used.
* Updated generated D1/D2 filenames so they indicate whether they were generated by ‘funding’ or ‘awarding’ agency.
* Improved Broker error handling and on-screen display of error messages.
* Various UI improvements (UI for FABS submissions post-publication, UI tweaks to File A generation)
* Various backend process improvements with file generation, validator, certification tables, USPS data loader, and job handling
