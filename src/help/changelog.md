#### July 13, 2021{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Implemented DAIMS 2.1 guidance on submission of ObjectClass (OC) and DisasterEmergencyFundCode (DEFC) elements. 
* DEFC ‘9’ is no longer valid for submission as a generic placeholder, only valid DEFC may be submitted.
* Object Class format modified to match GTAS format.
* Modified several validation rules impacted by DEFC and OC changes.
