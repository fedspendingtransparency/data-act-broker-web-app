#### November 21, 2023{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated interface to rebrand the "DATA Act Broker" to simply "Data Broker" and the "DAIMS" (DATA Act Information Model Schema) to "GSDM" (Governmentwide Spending Data Model) in preparation for the next release.
* Began to automatically generate File A based on agencyâ€™s GTAS submission for that same period. If an agency prefers to submit their own File A in lieu of the Broker generated version, agencies will first need to upload File B and C and run the validations with the Broker generated File A. After validations of the 3 files are complete, the Broker Generated File A can then be replaced with a different File A and rerun the validations on the new File A.
