#### August 10, 2016

In this version of the Broker, we separated out the validation checks into warnings and critical errors, added the interface to create D1 and D2 files, improved 508 compliance, increased server capacity, added an interface for broker users to notify other users that a submission is ready, and fixed a bug that incorrectly showed submissions as valid on the home page submission table.

#### Warnings and Errors{section=warnings}

In previous versions of the Broker, all failing validations were treated as critical errors. In this release, we have added an almost identical interface for the warnings, complete with a downloadable file and table. The warnings appear alongside the existing error download and tables. Files with warnings may be submitted, but files with critical errors will not pass validation and may not be submitted.

#### Generating D1 and D2{section=d1d2}

In previous versions of the Broker, you could only upload a D2 file. If you didn't have a D2 file, you could use the sample file provided. In this release, we have added the interface to generate the D1 and D2 files. **PLEASE NOTE** that the interface currently returns sample files until the integration with the ASP and FPDS is complete in the next 2-3 weeks.

#### Improved 508 Compliance{section=508compliance}

In this release, the Broker has further improved it's compliance with 508 accessibility guidelines.

#### Increase Server Capacity{section=capacity}

In this release, the development team has significantly increased the base capacity of the web and database servers powering the Broker.

#### Notify Another User{section=notifyauser}

Broker users can now send a notification to another user within their same agency when they want them to view a submission. This option is available on the Review Data page, after all validations have completed. You can also send other users in your agency the link to your in-progress submission anytime.

#### Bugfix: Submissions Incorrectly Show as Valid{section=homepagesubmissiontable}

Several users reported a minor bug with the submission table that appears on the home page. It was showing submissions as valid that actually had errors. This has been corrected to more accurately reflect the status of a submission.

#### Updated Validations{section=updatedValidations}
Below is a cumulative table of validations in the RSS. The status column indicates whether they are currently implemented in the Broker. Some rules that were already implemented in the Broker were changed in the release of the Errata. The currently implemented rule and new rule are both listed below, with corresponding version indicators in the rule label (i.e. "C14 (v1)" or "C14 (v2)").

#### Accessibility Statement{section=accessibilityStatement}

**Commitment and Guidelines**

Alpha-broker.usaspending.gov is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. To meet this commitment we develop this website to conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/). These guidelines explain how to make websites more accessible to people with disabilities, and we believe they also make our website easier for everyone to use.
The [Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) addresses accessibility challenges by defining new ways to provide functionality with assistive technology. With WAI-ARIA, developers are able to provide usable and accessible advanced Web applications to people with disabilities. Alpha-broker.usaspending.gov also uses The Voluntary Product Accessibility Template® (VPAT®) to document adherence with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act accessibility standards.

We know our website changes regularly so we’re always looking for ways to improve.
