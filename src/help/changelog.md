#### November 23, 2016
On September 30, 2016, we released the full version of the DATA Act Broker that contained everything agencies need to test the data validation and submission process. Now we are making improvements to the Broker and responding to issues discovered through greater agency use.

In this version of the Broker, we are using MAX to manage user account permissions, we updated how the Broker processes several rules and reports errors, added a FAQ for TransactionObligatedAmount, and provided the information on the Submission Dashboard in two tables, one for in progress, and one for completed and certified.

##### Sign In Using MAX{section=logMAX}

Agency Admins have the ability to set up read, write, and submitter permissions for MAX groups. Broker enforces read only, write only, and submitter permissions. If your coworkers are having trouble signing in, they should contact their agency administrator for MAX. If the agency doesn't have a MAX administrator, email DATAPMO@fiscal.treasury.gov.

##### Accessibility Statement{section=accessibilityStatement}

###### Commitment and Guidelines

The DATA Act implementation team is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. To meet this commitment we develop this website to conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/). These guidelines explain how to make websites more accessible to people with disabilities, and we believe they also make our website easier for everyone to use.
The [Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) addresses accessibility challenges by defining new ways to provide functionality with assistive technology. With WAI-ARIA, developers are able to provide usable and accessible advanced Web applications to people with disabilities. Alpha-broker.usaspending.gov also uses The Voluntary Product Accessibility Template® (VPAT®) to document adherence with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act accessibility standards.

We know our website changes regularly so we’re always looking for ways to improve. If there is information you think should be included on this page, or if you experience any difficulty accessing this site, please contact us at [DATABroker@fiscal.treasury.gov](mailto:DATABroker@fiscal.treasury.gov) for assistance.
