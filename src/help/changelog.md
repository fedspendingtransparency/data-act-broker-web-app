#### June 25, 2024{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated Federal Hierarchy loader and office data to include effective dates. This will be used with the updated FABS rules (21.1, 21.2, 23.1, 23.2, 38.2.1, 38.2.2, 38.4.1, 38.4.2) to determine if an office is active as of the action date.
* Continued work of cleaning up the frontend interface for 508 compliance.
* Updated error and warning reports to consistently alphabetize the list values (currently applicable to only DABS/FABS errors and warnings).
