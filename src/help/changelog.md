#### January 13, 2026{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Removed FABS36 as the AssistanceListingNumber format will be changed and checked via FABS37.3.
* Updated B28 to include an exception: the rule will be ignored if every balance on the row is $0 and the PARK is “0” or “0000”.
