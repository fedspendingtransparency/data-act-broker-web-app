#### May 3, 2021{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated validation rules C20, C21, and C26 to only return the values that are failing this check in the `Difference` column. This should make the reports more readable and assist agencies in quickly investigating and resolving these warnings.
* Resolved some minor frontend bugs regarding sorting of errors and warnings, fixing banners, and displaying certain error messages properly.
