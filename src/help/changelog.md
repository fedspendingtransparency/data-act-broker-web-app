#### January 21, 2025{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated several PARK and USSGL columns in File B and C to match the terse 30 headers.
* Removed the FY24 Submission Schedule calendar and updated the Validation Rules link in the Resources Help page per GSDM 1.1.
* Removed the sample file links in the DABS Submission Guide. They are still available and current via the GSDM link in the same section.
