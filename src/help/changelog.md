#### September 21, 2020{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Reloaded Broker City Code table and ensured validations account for a City Code spanning more than one state.
* Updated logic for DABS Validation Rule C23 such that only File C lines with a value for TOA will be compared to D1/D2.
* Modified the “Upload & Validate a New Submission” page of the DABS workflow to inform users upon selecting the period if an existing Published or Certified submission already exists for the reporting period they chose.
* Added a filter for Test Submissions on the DABS Active Submission Table.
* Minor bug fixes
