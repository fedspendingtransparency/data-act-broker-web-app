#### December 21, 2016
On September 30, 2016, we released the full version of the DATA Act Broker that contained everything agencies need to test the data validation and submission process. Now we are making improvements to the Broker and responding to issues discovered through greater agency use.

In this version of the Broker, users are able to generate D files outside of a submission, rules that were temporarily warnings are changed back to errors, the Broker is available at a new URL, rule B5 is updated, object class validations require a specific value when an object class is unknown, and MAX permissions allow users who are part of of multiple agency permission groups to have different permissions for different agencies.

##### Generate D Files Outside of a Submission{section=Dfiles}

Users will be able to generate D files outside the context of a submission. In other words, they won't need to validate A-C to be able to generate D files.

##### Temporary Warnings Changed Back to Errors{section=warnings2Errors}

All Rules that were temporarily warnings are changed back to critical errors. These warnings were documented on the validation table on the Help page, with a note that they would become errors in the future. The exception to this is rule A33, which will remain a warning for now.
 
##### New URL for Data Broker{section=URL}

The Data Broker is now be available at broker.usaspending.gov. All users should be automatically redirected.

##### Object Class Validation Update{section=objectClass}

Object Class validations only allow the object classes listed in the domain values. If the object class is unknown, agencies should use '000' instead of a value of their choosing.

##### MAX Group Permissions Allow for Different Permissions for a User Who is Part of a Multiple Agency Permission Group{section=maxGroup}

Updates to the MAX group permissions  allow for different permissions for different agencies, when a user is part of multiple agency permission groups, such as shared service providers.

##### Browser Requirements & Known Issues{section=browser}
The Broker is currently tested with the following browsers:

* Internet Explorer version 10 and higher
* Firefox (current version)

Although you may use any browser/version combination you wish, we cannot support browsers and versions other than the ones stated above.

##### Accessibility Statement{section=accessibilityStatement}

###### Commitment and Guidelines

The DATA Act implementation team is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. To meet this commitment we develop this website to conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/). These guidelines explain how to make websites more accessible to people with disabilities, and we believe they also make our website easier for everyone to use.
The [Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) addresses accessibility challenges by defining new ways to provide functionality with assistive technology. With WAI-ARIA, developers are able to provide usable and accessible advanced Web applications to people with disabilities. Alpha-broker.usaspending.gov also uses The Voluntary Product Accessibility Template® (VPAT®) to document adherence with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act accessibility standards.

We know our website changes regularly so we’re always looking for ways to improve. If there is information you think should be included on this page, or if you experience any difficulty accessing this site, please contact us at [DATABroker@fiscal.treasury.gov](mailto:DATABroker@fiscal.treasury.gov) for assistance.
