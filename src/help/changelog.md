#### February 8, 2022{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Fixed a few minor bugs with validation rules.
* Updated naming convention for Broker files as they appear on the Submission History page for clarity. Now the user is better able to determine the contents of the file prior to downloading or once they have saved it locally. This will apply to new submissions moving forward as files are created, existing files for existing submissions are not being renamed.
* Removed the ability to create new Quarterly submissions for FY22 and forward as all submissions for current and future periods are now required to be Monthly submissions.
* Updated the Service Desk information on the Broker Help page for accuracy.
* Added timestamps in the Broker workflow to let users know when a given set of Validations last ran and when D1 or D2 files were last generated.
