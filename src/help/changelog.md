#### December 7, 2021{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Added progress bars to the first set of validations the user sees in DABS and FABS. This will display the estimated progress the Broker has made while running validations on the submitted files so the user can gauge how long until the validations are complete. Cross file validation progress bars are planned to be added in a future release.
