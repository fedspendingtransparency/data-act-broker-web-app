#### What's New in This Release - July 13, 2016

NOTE: The DATA Act Broker - Alpha Release is now in beta status (as of the June 29, 2016 release). We will be updating the related text indicators on the website in the next release. The URL ([https://alpha-broker.usaspending.gov](https://alpha-broker.usaspending.gov)) will not change for now.

In this version of the Broker, we changed the submission date timeframe, reduced the errors generated by blanks, improved the display of the tree map for errors, display the cross file validations, and updated some more validations to SQL. 

  - [Reporting Date Timeframe](#/help?section=reportingDateTimeframe)
  - [Tree Map for Errors](#/help?section=treeMap)
  - [Display of Cross-File Validations](#/help?section=crossFileValv2)
  - [More Validations in SQL](#/help?section=validationSQL2)
  - [Updated Validations](#/help?section=updatedValidations)

#### Reporting Date Timeframe{section=reportingDateTimeframe}
When you create a new submission, the date selection is for one month or one quarter. Examples: June 2016 or Quarter 4 - 2016.

#### Tree Map for Errors{section=treeMap}
We updated the color of the tree map and the language used to describe the errors. Look for further improvements to the error descriptions in future releases.

#### Display of Cross-File Validations{section=crossFileValv2}
After each individual file is validated, the Broker performs some cross-file validations. You will now see the results of these validations in the Broker, see a table of errors,  
be able to download an error report, and upload corrected files.

#### More Validations in SQL{section=validationSQL2}
Agency developers may be interested to know that we transitioned more of the Broker validations to using SQL statements. The list of SQL statements is publically available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker-backend/tree/master/dataactvalidator/config/sqlrules).

#### Updated Validations{section=updatedValidations}
In this release we have transitioned all of these validations to SQL except A1, B9, and B10. See cumulative table of validations above.

#### What's New in This Release - June 29, 2016
In this version of the Broker, we made several small changes to make the Broker easier to use, added a section to display submissions from your agency, clarified the process to upload corrected files, added an email notification feature, transitioned some of the validation rules to SQL statements, and updated some of the validations. 

  - [Ease of Use Improvements](#/help?section=easeofUse)
  - [Submissions from Your Agency](#/help?section=agencySubdashboard)

#### Ease of Use Improvements{section=easeofUse}
- **Confirm Password** When you create a Broker account, you are prompted to enter a Password and then to Confirm Password.
- **Username** On the log in screen, we have replaced the Username prompt with Email Address since your user name is your email address.
- **Submission Guide** If you hide the Submission Guide page, when you select your agency for a new submission, there is a link to view the Submission Guide. The Submission Guide also has a link to the validations listed on this Help page.
- **Default Dates** When creating your submission, the dates default to the beginning of the fiscal year and the current month or quarter.
- **Last Saved** The Broker automatically saves your files when you upload them and at each step of the validation process. The date and time the data was last saved is displayed at the top of the screen below the Help menu. 
- **Leave Validations Running** You can leave the validation page and the validations will continue to run. Come back at any time to check your progress or results.
- **Spam Folder Warning** Some users report that emails from the Broker end up in their spam folders. We've added a reminder to check your spam folder on pages that generate emails.
- **Back to Top** We know this Help page is getting long so we added an arrow in the lower right corner. Click it to take you back to the top of the page at any time.

#### Submissions from Your Agency{section=agencySubdashboard}
We've added a table to the Broker home page where you can see recent submissions from your agency. View and edit submissions from this table.

#### Uploading Corrected Files{section=uploadCorrectedFiles}
If one or more of your files fails validation, only those failed files will have a prompt in red for you to upload a corrected file. Click *Choose Corrected File* to browse to your file and select it. Or drag and drop a corrected file onto the file icon. Click *Upload Corrected CSV Files*. The validations on the corrected files will run again.

#### Send Email Notifications{section=sendEmail}
After your data has been successfully validated, the *Review & Publish* page has a button to *Notify Another User that the Submission is Ready for Certification*. This opens a field where you can type in multiple email addresses for users in your agency. 

#### Some Validations in SQL{section=validationSQL}
Agency developers may be interested to know that we transitioned some of the Broker validations to using SQL statements. The list of SQL statements is publically available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker-backend/tree/master/dataactvalidator/config/sqlrules).

#### Updated Validations{section=updatedValidations}
In this release we included rules A18, A19, A20, B9, B10, B11, B12, and C18. See cumulative table above.

#### What's New in This Release - June 15, 2016
In this version of the Broker, we made it easier to select your agency, made it easier to submit your data without errors, and updated some of the validations. 

* [Easier Agency Selection](#/help?section=agencyCGAC)
* [Accidental Commas in Dollar Amounts](#/help?section=removeCommas)
* [Header Row Capitalization Errors](#/help?section=elementCaps)

#### Easier Agency Selection{section=agencyCGAC}
When you register for an account or create a submission, you can enter your CGAC code to correctly select your agency.

#### Accidental Commas in Dollar Amounts{section=removeCommas}
The Practices and Procedures document specifies that dollar amounts should be submitted without commas. However, if you accidentally include commas in dollar amounts the Broker will remove them.

#### Header Row Capitalization Errors{section=elementCaps}
The Practices and Procedures document specifies that the element names in the header row should exactly match the RSS element names. However, to assist you the Broker will process files with incorrect element name capitalization.
#### What's New in This Release - June 1, 2016
In this version of the broker, we have added some information on the screens to help you with your data submission, added some functionality to help you select the reporting period, and updated some of the validations. __Note:__ Validation details are included in the cumulative updated validations table.

* [Step-by-Step Guide on the Broker Home Page](#/help?section=stepby)
* [Submission Guide](#/help?section=subguide)
* [Selecting Reporting Period](#/help?section=dateselect)

#### Step-by-Step Guide on the Broker Home Page{section=stepby}
When you log into the Broker, you will see three choices that guide you to _Upload and validate a new submission_, _Continue with an existing submission_, and _Review, certify, and publish a submission_.

#### Submission Guide{section=subguide}
The Submission Guide provides details of the four steps to submit your agency's data. Once you have reviewed this page, you can check a box to hide this page the next time you log into the Broker.
        
#### Select Reporting Period{section=dateselect}
Based on user feedback, the quarterly submission dates are displayed as the quarter number and the fiscal year. Example: Quarter 2 - 2016.

#### What's New in This Release - May 17, 2016
In this version of the Broker, we have made a change if you are logging in with Internet Explorer, added functionality for the Broker to recognize files with the pipe symbol as a delimiter, and updated some of the validations.

* [Logging into the Broker with Internet Explorer](#/help?section=brokerIE)
* [Submit Files with Pipe Symbol](#/help?section=pipe)
* [File Validations per RSS v1.0](#/help?section=fileValv1)
* [Cross File Validations](#/help?section=crossFileValv1)

#### Logging into the Broker with Internet Explorer{section=brokerIE}
During user testing, some Internet Explorer users were unable to log into the Broker and upload files. We implemented a workaround so users with Internet Explorer on __medium security settings__ can log in and upload files. See Known Issues below.

#### Submit File with Pipe Symbol{section=pipe}
Based on user feedback, we changed the Broker to automatically detect whether a file is using a comma or pipe symbol as a delimiter, based on the format of the header row.

#### File Validations per RSS v1.0{section=fileValv1}
Submitted files will be validated per RSS v1.0. Specifically:
* Field names match the RSS v1.0
* Maximum field length does not exceed the value in RSS v1.0
* Required fields are present per RSS v1.0
* Records in File C have a PIID, FAIN, or URI 

#### Cross File Validations{section=crossFileValv1}
We started work on cross file validations, beginning with cross validation of the FAIN, URI or PIID between sample files for Files C and D2.
