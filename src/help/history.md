* [Cross File Validations](#/help?section=crossFileValv1)

#### Logging into the Broker with Internet Explorer{section=brokerIE}
During user testing, some Internet Explorer users were unable to log into the Broker and upload files. We implemented a workaround so users with Internet Explorer on __medium security settings__ can log in and upload files. See Known Issues below.

#### Submit File with Pipe Symbol{section=pipe}
Based on user feedback, we changed the Broker to automatically detect whether a file is using a comma or pipe symbol as a delimiter, based on the format of the header row.

#### File Validations per RSS v1.0{section=fileValv1}
Submitted files will be validated per RSS v1.0. Specifically:
* Field names match the RSS v1.0
* Maximum field length does not exceed the value in RSS v1.0
* Required fields are present per RSS v1.0
* Records in File C have a PIID, FAIN, or URI 

#### Cross File Validations{section=crossFileValv1}
We started work on cross file validations, beginning with cross validation of the FAIN, URI or PIID between sample files for Files C and D2.
