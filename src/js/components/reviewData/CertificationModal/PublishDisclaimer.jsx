                    requirements under the DATA Act and OMB M-20-21, and that the reported data was produced following
                    my agency’s normal practices and procedures, including the same systems and methods used to certify
                    the agency’s last quarterly submission.  I attest that I will continue to evaluate this data,
                    following data quality control processes, and will thereafter certify the data, including any
                    corrections, in the next quarterly certification statement, consistent with OMB A-123, Appendix A.
