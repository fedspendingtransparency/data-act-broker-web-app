            <ul>
                <li>
                Updated the Broker so that DABS data cannot be certified prior to
                the opening of the DABS submission window. Such data can still be
                tested as normal
                </li>
                <li>
                Updated the Broker so data that was validated or generated prior to
                the opening of the certification window for a given quarter must be
                revalidated once the submission window for that quarter opens. This
                ensures that DABS validations are run against the full set of GTAS
                data) and that D files are not outdated for purposes of publication
                and cross-file validation.
                </li>
                <li>Minor UI improvement (display tweak to help page)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>February 25, 2019</h4>
            {releaseStatement}

            <ul>
                <li>
                Updated FABS 39.3, FABS41.1 and FABS41.2 so that they allow for
                valid city codes in the ####R format. Updated FABS39.1 to properly
                implement the city-code format check, and to allow for ####R format
                to be used.
                </li>
                <li>
                Updated generated D1/D2 filenames so they indicate whether they were
                generated by ‘funding’ or ‘awarding’ agency.
                </li>
                <li>
                Improved Broker error handling and on-screen display of error
                messages.
                </li>
                <li>
                Various UI improvements (UI for FABS submissions post-publication,
                UI tweaks to File A generation)
                </li>
                <li>
                Various backend process improvements with file generation,
                validator, certification tables, USPS data loader, and job handling
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>February 7, 2019</h4>
            {releaseStatement}

            <ul>
                <li>
                Updated the Broker to implement the Federal Hierarchy validations
                and derivations described in DAIMS v1.3. Implemented a related
                one-time data enhancement that backfills office names from 10/1/2018
                forward in FABS using provided office codes and the Federal
                Hierarchy.
                </li>
                <li>
                Updated the Broker File A Generation in DABS to be based on period
                rather than fiscal quarter (quarters can still be generated by
                selecting periods 03, 06, 09, and 12, so no functionality was lost).
                </li>
                <li>
                Updated Help section of the Broker to streamline it and reduce
                redundancies between it and the Fiscal Service DAIMS page
                (https://fiscal.treasury.gov/data-transparency/) and the Broker.
                </li>
                <li>Various API documentation and error message improvements.</li>
                <li>
                Updated job file size limit and memory management to allow larger
                D1/D2 files to generate without issue.
                </li>
                <li>
                Various minor updates and improvements (Updated DABS Submission
                calendar document, Updated links to relaunched Fiscal Service
                Website, updated duplicate publication check to catch additional
                edge-case, improved special character handling in filenames and
                carriage return handling within data cells).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>November 30, 2018</h4>
            {releaseStatement}

            <ul>
                <li>
                Updated the Broker to generate a provisional File A for agencies
                that they may use as a submission starting point (though only
                certifying to it if they verify its accuracy and completeness) or
                for reconciliation purposes. File A generation is accessed from the
                DABS homepage and happens outside the submission context.
                </li>
                <li>Various API documentation and error message improvements.</li>
                <li>
                Various memory management fixes that were causing publishing
                submissions to hang in isolated cases.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>November 1, 2018</h4>
            {releaseStatement}

            <ul>
                <li>
                Updated Broker upload step to check the file type and only allow
                .CSV or .TXT (other file extensions will be rejected prior to
                uploading).
                </li>
                <li>
                The Broker now allows agencies to (optionally) generate File D1 and
                D2 by funding agency on both the detached File D page and within a
                submission.
                </li>
                <li>
                Added the last two filters to the Submission Dashboard pages. They
                allow filtering by the user that created the submission and the Last
                Modified Date of the submission.
                </li>
                <li>
                Reduced Broker user session timeout to a more reasonable timespan
                (30 minutes of inactivity).
                </li>
                <li>
                Various Broker Inbound API documentation improvements based on user
                feedback.
                </li>
                <li>Various minor bug fixes and improvements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>October 11, 2018</h4>
            {releaseStatement}

            <ul>
                <li>Updated all Broker download URLs to use a .gov domain.</li>
                <li>
                Improved inbound API documentation, error handling, and error
                messages based on user feedback.
                </li>
                <li>
                Updated Broker generated D1/D2 File layout and casing so it is fully
                consistent with DAIMS.
                </li>
                <li>Various backend improvements in error handling, tools.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>September 25, 2018</h4>

            {releaseStatement}

            <ul>
                <li>
                Added frontend functionality to filter the Submission Dashboard by
                agency.
                </li>
                <li>
                Updated detached D file generation to immediately return cached
                files.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>September 5, 2018</h4>

            <p>In this release of the Broker, we:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                Updated rule B9 (which checks that the provided TAS/Program Activity
                matches the authoritative source from OMB) so that users can submit
                or resubmit data for FY17Q2 or FY17Q3 without triggering a warning.
                Note that the rule is not applicable to this timeframe as the OMB
                BDR Program Activity process was not in place yet.
                </li>
                <li>
                Updated backend to improve the user experience and reduce instances
                of hung submissions.
                </li>
                <li>
                Made various backend improvements related to adding submission
                dashboard filters. Added the first two of these filters to the
                frontend, with the rest of the filters to come soon.
                </li>
                <li>
                Backend update to pave the way for a DAIMS v1.3 change allowing
                agencies to choose to generate D files based on funding agency
                (default will still be to generate by awarding agency, the current
                behavior).
                </li>
                <li>
                Fixed a bug that was preventing a new file from being generated in
                some cases when D1/D2 dates were changed.
                </li>
                <li>
                Updated the frontend so that it provided a better sense that file
                uploads were in progress.
                </li>
                <li>
                Corrected a minor bug in Firefox that affected file reuploads.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>August 22, 2018</h4>

            {releaseStatement}

            <ul>
                <li>
                Made various backend improvements related to an upcoming feature
                adding submission dashboard filters.
                </li>
                <li>
                Now that DAIMS documents are hosted in a single location on the
                Bureau of the Fiscal Service website, we streamlined the Broker help
                pages to reduce duplication of effort and the chance for documents
                hosted in multiple places to get out of sync. The Resources tab now
                includes a link to the aforementioned DAIMS section of the Fiscal
                Service website.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>August 2, 2018</h4>

            {releaseStatement}

            <ul>
                <li>
                Made various backend improvements related to the inbound API
                development work.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>July 18, 2018</h4>

            <p>In this release of the Broker, we made the following updates:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                Made various backend improvements related to the inbound API
                development work.
                </li>
                <li>
                Updated Program Activity (PA) loader to detect new PA files, skip
                bad rows, and load updated PA files automatically into the Broker
                Validation database on a nightly basis as the data is updated in the
                OMB MAX Collect Exercise.
                </li>
                <li>Fixed a bug in rule B9 fiscal year and quarter validation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>July 5, 2018</h4>

            <p>In this release of the Broker, we made the following updates:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                Made various backend improvements related to the inbound API
                development work.
                </li>
                <li>
                Upload Corrected Files button on the cross-file page is no longer
                clickable unless there is a new file selected to be uploaded.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>June 19, 2018</h4>

            <p>In this release of the Broker, we made the following updates:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                Various backend improvements related to the inbound API development
                work.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>June 6, 2018</h4>

            <p>In this release of the Broker, we</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                Updated USPS zip code data used in Broker derivations and
                validations with that in USPS’s PostalPro product
                (https://postalpro.usps.com/address-quality-solutions/zip-4-product).
                We expect this will have a minimal but positive impact to agencies,
                since this is the most up-to-date ZIP database available. Agencies
                that purchase their own ZIP+4 product for internal validation
                purposes should take note.
                </li>
                <li>
                V arious mop-up tasks related to DAIMS 1.2 Broker deploy (finished
                updating all hyperlinks throughout the Broker to DAIMS v1.2
                documents, removed FiscalYearQuarterCorrection and
                LegalEntityAddressLine3 from DABS-generated D1/D2 files, reordered
                the elements in DABS-generated D1/D2 files to match DAIMS 1.2, and
                changed primaryplaceofperformancezip_4 header to
                primaryplaceofperformancezip+4 in DABS-generated D1/D2 files to
                conform with DAIMS).
                </li>
                <li>
                Fixed a minor bug with Broker navigation within the Help sections.
                </li>
                <li>
                Updated the subaward loader to check for PIID/FAIN with and without
                dashes when looking for award identifiers to match the FSRS records
                to.
                </li>
                <li>
                Because the Broker documentation has included two different terse
                labels (place_of_performance_zip4 and place_of_performance_zip4a)
                for PrimaryPlaceOfPerformanceZIP+4 over time, we updated the Broker
                to accept either.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>May 18, 2018</h4>

            <p>
                In this release of the Broker, we implemented updates to both FABS and
                DABS to comply with the DATA Act Information Model Schema (DAIMS)
                v1.2. Click
                <a href="https://community.max.gov/x/Dwn4Tg"> here</a> to see the

                information to assist with your DABS submission.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: DABS and FABS submissions after May 18, 2018 must comply with
                DAIMS v1.2. This includes re-certifications of previous DABS
                submissions and updates to FABS submissions.
            </p>

            <h4>April 26, 2018</h4>

            <p>In this release of the Broker, we made the following updates:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                Updated A33 so that it does not prompt warnings if financing
                accounts are not included in File A.
                </li>
                <li>
                Updated rule C5 functionality so that it works similarly to B5.
                </li>
                <li>
                Updated the functionality of C8, C11, and C23 so that they apply
                when ATA is the same as the AID (previously these rules were ignored
                whenever ATA was filled in, including when ATA was the same as the
                AID).
                </li>
                <li>
                Corrected C9 so that it does not prompt warnings for awards with
                negative OriginalLoanSubsidyCost.
                </li>
                <li>
                Note: FABS changes due to DAIMS v1.2 implementation will go live on
                May 18.

            <p>
                In this release of the Broker, agencies are now able to make changes
                to previously certified files. To update a previously certified
                submission, go to the submissions that you want to correct and upload
                the corrected files. Go through the file validations and certify the
                corrected files.
            </p>

            <h5 name="reportFix">Error report fix</h5>
            <p>
                In previous versions of the Broker, users experienced an issue with
                the error report not showing the same number of errors listed on the
                submission page. We rolled out a fix to correct this issue.
            </p>

            <h5 name="c9warning">C9 warning message</h5>
            <p>
                In the previous version of the Broker, the C9 validation was not
                consistently producing warnings. We updated the implementation to
                reflect the C9 validation rule in the DAIMS that states, &ldquo;Unique FAIN
                and/or URI from file D2 should exist in file C, except D2 records
                where FederalActionObligation and OriginalLoanSubsidyCost = 0. FAIN
                may be null for aggregated records. URI may be null for non-aggregated
                records.&rdquo;

                In the previous version of the Broker, the C12 validation was not
                consistently producing warnings. We updated the implementation to
                reflect the C12 validation rule in the DAIMS that states, &ldquo;Each unique
                PIID (or combination of PIID/ParentAwardId) from file D1 should exist
                in file C during the same reporting period, except D1 records where
                FederalActionObligation = 0.&rdquo;

                In this release of the Broker, agencies are now able to certify and

                B11 and C11/C12 validation rules, and Program Activity case
                sensitivity. We also improved the submission dashboard functionality
                and updated the warning and error messages to reflect clarifications
                to the validation rules. submission dashboard and the warning and
                error messages were updated to reflect recent changes to the
                validation rules.

            <h5 name="data">Data Submission</h5>
            <p>
                In this release of the Broker, agencies are now able to certify and
                submit data. Certified data will be available in the DATA Act Outbound
                Application Programming Interface (API) and will be sent to the data
                store for publication on the future website. All test submissions
                certified before March 15th are marked as not certified and are not
                available for publication unless the files are recertified.
            </p>

            <h5 name="case">Program Activity case sensitive fix</h5>
            <p>
                In this release of the Broker, we rolled out a fix to make validations
                for Program Activity not case sensitive.
            </p>

            <h5 name="b11">B11 validation fix</h5>
            <p>
                In previous versions of the Broker, the B11 validation produced an
                error for a blank reimbursable/direct indicator. In this release, we
                updated the B11 validation to only check for Object Class validity.
            </p>

            <h5 name="c11">C11/C12 validation fix</h5>
            <p>
                In the previous version of the Broker, the C11/C12 validation produced
                a warning if both PIID and ParentAwardID were submitted. We corrected
                this to not produce a warning if both PIID and ParentAwardID are
                submitted.
            </p>

            <h5 name="flex">Flex field fix</h5>
            <p>
                In previous versions of the Broker, flex fields were not available in
                the cross file validation reports. We updated the Broker to show flex
                fields in the cross file validation reports.
            </p>

            <h5 name="warning">Updated warning/error messages</h5>
            <p>
                In this release of the Broker, we updated the warning and error
                messages to reflect clarifications made to the validation rules from
                recent releases.
            </p>

            <h5 name="imp">Functionality improvement</h5>
            <p>
                We updated the submission dashboard to allow the user to sort the
                submission tables by any of the column headers.

            <p>
                In previous versions of the Broker, the B14/B15 validation would
                produce a failure in the File B related to GTAS lines 2004 (direct)
                and 2104(reimbursable). In this release of the Broker, the B14/B15
                validation was updated to add up correctly to compare against the SF
                133 lines 2004/2104.
            </p>

            <h5 name="c8">C8/C9 validation fix</h5>
            <p>
                In earlier versions of the Broker, the C8/C9 validations produced
                warnings if both a FAIN and URI were reported for a record. In this
                release, the C8/C9 validation will not trigger a warning if both a
                FAIN and URI are reported together.
            </p>

            <h5 name="c23">C23 validation fix</h5>
            <p>
                In this release of the Broker, the C23 cross file validation was
                updated so that if <code>parent_award_id</code> is present, both{" "}
                <code>PIID</code> and <code>parent_award_id</code> are used to cross
                validate Files C and D1. If <code>parent_award_id</code> is not
                present, the validator compares <code>PIID</code> in File C to the{" "}
                <code>PIID</code> in File D1 only.
            </p>

            <h5 name="sgl">Reporting SGL data in File C</h5>
            <p>
                In earlier versions of the Broker, the validation rules were
                generating warnings for File C submissions that had SGL balances for
                an award without D1/D2 activity in the reporting period. In this
                release of the Broker, the C8/C9 and C11/C12 validations have been
                updated to only run on rows in File C that have a transaction
                obligated amount value in the field.
            </p>

            <h5 name="delete">Deleting an old submission</h5>
            <p>
                In this release of the Broker, we rolled out a delete button in the
                submission dashboard that upload users can use to delete non-certified
                submissions. Submissions that are deleted are permanently removed from
                the website and are unable to be recovered.
            </p>

            <h5 name="header">File B header processing fix</h5>
            <p>
                In this release of the Broker, we rolled out a functionality fix to
                allow users to submit File B that either does or does not have the
                typo on the
                DeobligationsRecoveriesRefundsdOfPriorYearByProgramObjectClass_CPE
                field.
            </p>

            <h5 name="cgac">Updated list of agency CGAC codes</h5>
            <p>
                In this release of the Broker, we implemented an updated list of
                agency CGAC codes, names and abbreviations. The full list is available
                <a href="https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker-backend/blob/development/dataactvalidator/config/agency_list.csv">

            <h5 name="improvements">Improved processing time fix</h5>
            <p>
                In this release, we implemented a solution to improve the processing
                and stability of file submissions at a high volume.
            </p>

            <h5 name="b11">B11 validation fix</h5>
            <p>
                Previously, the B11 validation was checking the direct/reimbursable
                flag. We updated this rule to check the object class only.
            </p>

            <h4>February 13, 2017</h4>

            <p>
                In this release of the Broker, bugs were fixed relating to downloading
                cross file warning/error reports, the B14/B15 validations, and Program
                Activities with the code &lsquo;0000&rsquo; and title &lsquo;Unknown/Other&rsquo;.
                Functionality improvements were rolled out, including downloading
                submission files, padding zero values for Object Class and Program
                Activity, and others.

            <p>
                In earlier versions of the Broker, the B14/B15 validations produced
                fatal errors. In this release, the B14/B15 validation was changed to a
                warning.

            <h5 name="pa">Program Activity</h5>
            <p>

            </p>

            <h5 name="cross">Cross file warning/error reports</h5>
            <p>
                We discovered a bug in the process for downloading cross file warning
                and error reports. This has been fixed and users should no longer
                experience issues when downloading the cross file warning and error
                reports.
            </p>

            <h5 name="improvements">Functionality Improvements</h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                File names on the submission page are now links that can download

                </li>

                <li>
                A Broker registration link has been added to the help page for users
                that do not have a Broker account.
                </li>
                <li>
                A column has been added for agency name in the submission dashboard.

                <li>
                Improved processing time for file submissions at a high volume.

            <h4>February 1, 2017</h4>

            <p>
                This release of the Broker was focused primarily on maintenance.
                Notable fixes rolled out in this release include improved processing
                of high volume files submissions and fixes for rules B9, B10, and B12.

            </ul>

            <h5 name="time">Improved processing time fix</h5>
            <p>
                In this release, we implemented a solution to improve the processing
                and stability of file submissions at a high volume.
            </p>

            <h5 name="b12">B12 validation fix</h5>
            <p>
                In earlier versions of the Broker, the B12 validation would prompt a
                warning if the Direct/Reimbursable (D/R) flag field was not populated
                for transfer USSGLs (4831, 4832, 4931), which conflicted with GTAS
                requirements. We made changes to this rule to allow for the submission
                of blank D/R fields when submitting transfer USSGLs (4831, 4832,
                4931).
            </p>

            <h5 name="b9">B9/B10 validation fix</h5>
            <p>
                In earlier versions of the Broker, the B9/B10 validations produced
                warnings for FY 2017 Program Activity codes. Treasury has not received
                the authoritative list of FY 2017 Program Activity codes yet. This
                rule was modified to only validate Program Activity for years that we
                have domain values for.
            </p>

            <h4>January 18, 2017</h4>

            <p>
                In this version of the Broker, several bugs were fixed relating to the
                flex fields, the C23 validation, file E creation, and rule B18.
                Additionally, financing accounts are now excluded from the A33
                validation, per the new loan policy.

            </ul>

            <h5 name="lexfield">Flex field fix</h5>
            <p>
                After the flex fields were rolled out in an earlier release, we
                discovered a bug where multiple instances of a flex field would cause
                submission files to return errors. This has been fixed and users
                should no longer experience errors when using flex fields in their
                files. The proper syntax for the flex field headers is{" "}
                <code>flex_</code>.
            </p>

            <h5 name="c23">C23 validation fix</h5>
            <p>
                In earlier versions of the broker, the C23 validation would produce a
                failure in cases where both amounts from C and D for an award were
                zero but reported as different data types (such as string vs a
                numeric). We&apos;ve fixed this bug so that even different data types that
                represent the same amount should match and not produce an error.
            </p>

            <h5 name="filee">File E generation fix</h5>
            <p>
                Previously the file E generation was not working due to locked SAM
                credentials. A new SAM account has been created and deployed so that
                users should be able to generate their E file without error.
            </p>

            <h5 name="B18">Update to rule B18</h5>
            <p>
                Rule B18 was modified to prevent conflict with Rule B12, when downward
                djustment USSGLs are submitted with a blank D/R field.
            </p>

            <h5 name="A33">Financing accounts exclusion</h5>
            <p>
                Rule A33 was modified so that users will no longer see a warning if
                the submission does not include Financing Accounts.
            </p>

            <h4>December 21, 2016</h4>
            <p>
                In this version of the Broker, users are able to generate D files
                outside of a submission, rules that were temporarily warnings are
                changed back to errors, the Broker is available at a new URL, rule B5
                is updated, object class validations require a specific value when an
                object class is unknown, and MAX permissions allow users who are part
                of of multiple agency permission groups to have different permissions
                for different agencies.

            <h5 name="Dfiles">Generate D Files Outside of a Submission</h5>
            <p>
                Users will be able to generate D files outside the context of a
                submission. In other words, they won&apos;t need to validate A-C to be able
                to generate D files.

                Temporary Warnings Changed Back to Errors
            </h5>
            <p>
                All Rules that were temporarily warnings are changed back to critical
                errors. These warnings were documented on the validation table on the
                Help page, with a note that they would become errors in the future.
                The exception to this is rule A33, which will remain a warning for
                now.

            <p>
                The Data Broker is now be available at broker.usaspending.gov. All
                users should be automatically redirected.

            <h5 name="objectClass">Object Class Validation Update</h5>
            <p>
                Object Class validations only allow the object classes listed in the
                domain values. If the object class is unknown, agencies should use
                &lsquo;000&rsquo; instead of a value of their choosing. Please note that only
                &lsquo;000&rsquo; will be accepted by the broker, not &lsquo;0&rsquo; or &lsquo;00&rsquo;. If you&apos;re
                editing your files in Excel, you may need to pay careful attention to
                the formatting of the object class column to make sure it does not
                truncate the value to &lsquo;0&rsquo;.

            <h5 name="flexfields">Flex Fields</h5>
            <p>
                Users can now add additional columns to their submission files (A-C)
                that will be returned in their warning and error files. To use this
                feature, add any column to your submission data and prefix the header
                with &ldquo;flex\_&rdquo;. For example, a column named &ldquo;flex_reportingbureau&rdquo; will
                be ignored for validation purposes but returned for any rows that have
                errors in the warnings and error reports.
            </p>

            <h5 name="comments">Comments in Certification</h5>
            <p>
                Users can now add comments to each file during the certification
                process. On the final summary screen, you can select the file you wish
                to add comments for and write free-form prose to accompany that file
                for certification purposes.
            </p>

            <h5 name="whitespace">White space bugfix</h5>
            <p>
                In previous versions of the broker, rows of white space at the end of
                a file would cause validation errors. This was common for users
                exporting from excel. The broker will now ignore rows at the end of
                the file if all of the values are whitespace.
            </p>

            <h5 name="local">Improvements to the Local Install process</h5>
            <p>
                In this release we made improvements to the local install process for
                the broker so that users can more easily install the local broker for
                internal use.
            </p>

            <h5 name="rounding">Rounding Error bugfix</h5>
            <p>
                In previous versions of the broker, certain GTAS lines were being
                rounded when the source data was imported into the broker. We&apos;ve
                resolved this issue to make sure the source data for all GTAS
                validations is correct.
            </p>

            <h5>November 30, 2016</h5>
            <p>
                In this version of the Broker, we are using MAX to manage user
                accounts, we updated how the Broker processes several rules and
                reports errors, revised Rule A16, and populated the information in the
                summary table on the final Broker screen.

                If you are seeing this in What&apos;s New in This Release, you already know
                about the MAX.gov sign in that was implemented with this release. If
                your coworkers are having trouble signing in, they should contact
                their agency administrator for MAX. If the agency doesn&apos;t have a MAX
                administrator, email DATAPMO@fiscal.treasury.gov
            </p>

            <h5 name="ValidationRules">Processing of Validation Rules</h5>
            <p>We updated how the Broker processes some rules.</p>

            <p>
                A16: The Broker will check for a published or publishable submission
                for the current fiscal year before running Rule A16 on Files A and B.
                File C is no longer checked for Rule A16 as the FYB data elements are
                optional in this file. Note: Rule A16 is updated in the Validation
                Rules table and the downloadable spreadsheet. See the Validation Rules
                page. B14 & B15: We fixed a sign problem in these rules. B20: If the
                program activity provided in File C is zero, null, or blank, then the
                Broker compares the combination of TAS and object class between Files
                B and C instead. C8 & C9: Updates to how the Broker checks FAIN and
                URI in these rules. C23: Errors are now displayed for this rule after
                the File C - D2 cross-file validation. Various rules: Downward
                adjustments are excluded, where applicable.
            </p>

            <h5 name="SummaryTable">Summary Table</h5>
            <p>
                The final Broker screen displays a summary of your agency&apos;
                submission. File size, number of rows, and number of warnings are
                displayed for the files you uploaded. Agency name and report start and
                end dates are displayed for your agency&apos; submission. The dollar
                amounts for total obligations incurred, total financial assistance
                obligations, and total procurement obligations are calculated from
                your agency&apos; submission and displayed.
            </p>

            <h4>What&apos;s New in This Release - October 21, 2016</h4>
            <p>
                On September 30, 2016, we released the full version of the DATA Act
                Broker that contained everything agencies need to test the data
                validation and submission process. Now we are making improvements to
                the Broker and responding to issues discovered through greater agency
                use.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this version of the Broker, we have improved the cross-file
                validation and file download experience, improved the Broker
                processing of PIID and FAIN/URI, and improved the readability of the
                Help pages.

                The cross-file validation reports now include the error text instead

                </li>
                <li>
                While the D1 and D2 files are being generated, the messaging is more
                descriptive, &ldquo;Creating your D1 and D2 files from ASP and FPDS. This

                If there is an error generating the file from ASP or FPDS, the
                message says, &ldquo;A problem occurred receiving data from ASP&rdquo; (or FPDS)
                instead of a generic 404 error.
                </li>
                <li>
                File E, Additional Awardee Attributes, can now be generated and

            </ul>

            <h6 name="helpReadability">Help Pages Readability</h6>
            <p>
                We have updated the styling of the Help pages to use consistent header

                also added a navigation bar to move between help pages.

            </p>

            <p>
                In this version of the Broker, we have improved how the Broker
                receives D1 and D2 file information from the USAspending UAT
                environment, added screens for certifying submissions, improved the
                data we are using for Broker testing, corrected a Resources file, and

            <h6 name="receivingd1d2">Receiving Files D1 and D2</h6>
            <p>
                In this release, we have improved how the Broker receives the data for
                Files D1 and D2 from the USAspending UAT environment that comes from
                ASP and FPDS. As a user, you should not see any changes, except better
                functionality.
            </p>

            <h6 name="certifyScreens">Screens for Certification</h6>
            <p>
                The Broker now displays the screens an SAO will use to certify a
                submission. The text on these screens is based on a Draft OMB policy
                memo. The screens are there for you to review and understand the
                language and process. Feel free to click on any option - you will NOT
                actually certify and submit data to USAspending, at this time.
            </p>

            <h6 name="testData">Broker Test Data</h6>
            <p>
                We are testing the Broker with actual agency data to better replicate
                your experiences. You won&apos;t see any changes in the Broker.
            </p>

            <h6 name="updatedValidations">Updated Validations</h6>
            <p>
                Below is a cumulative table of validations in the RSS and IDD. The
                status column indicates whether they are currently implemented in the
                Broker. The table has been revised to match the latest validations
                rules spreadsheet in the Resources section.
                <strong> Note:</strong> in the September 30, 2016 release the
                validation rules, resources, this release notes archive were moved to
                different pages. Use the left navigation pane on the Help home page to

            <p>
                In this version of the Broker, we are importing D1 and D2 file
                information from the USAspending UAT environment, improved the
                handling of encoding in files, corrected a Resources file, and added

            <h6 name="d1d2updated">Updated: Generating D1 and D2</h6>
            <p>
                In this release, we have added the ability to generate the D1 and D2
                files from the data in the USAspending UAT environment that comes from
                ASP and FPDS. The procurement data for File D1 is only available
                through 7/31/2016, at this time. Submit your financial assistance data
                for File D2 through the ASP UAT environment.
                <strong> Note:</strong> This functionality is newly implemented so let
                us know if you have problems.
            </p>

            <h6 name="encoding">Encoding in Files</h6>
            <p>
                Some users reported errors trying to submit files. We improved how the
                Broker handles some encoding scenarios so these errors are no longer
                generated.
            </p>

            <h4>What&apos;s New in This Release - August 10, 2016</h4>
            <p>
                In this version of the Broker, we separated out the validation checks
                into warnings and critical errors, added the interface to create D1
                and D2 files, improved 508 compliance, increased server capacity,
                added an interface for broker users to notify other users that a
                submission is ready, and fixed a bug that incorrectly showed
                submissions as valid on the home page submission table.

            <h6 name="warnings">Warnings and Errors</h6>
            <p>
                In previous versions of the Broker, all failing validations were
                treated as critical errors. In this release, we have added an almost
                identical interface for the warnings, complete with a downloadable
                file and table. The warnings appear alongside the existing error
                download and tables. Files with warnings may be submitted, but files
                with critical errors will not pass validation and may not be
                submitted.
            </p>

            <h6 name="d1d2">Generating D1 and D2</h6>
            <p>
                In previous versions of the Broker, you could only upload a D2 file.
                If you didn&apos;t have a D2 file, you could use the sample file provided.
                In this release, we have added the interface to generate the D1 and D2
                files. <strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong> that the interface currently
                returns sample files until the integration with the ASP and FPDS is
                complete in the next 2-3 weeks.
            </p>

            <h6 name="508compliance">Improved 508 Compliance</h6>
            <p>
                In this release, the Broker has further improved it&apos;s compliance with
                508 accessibility guidelines.
            </p>

            <h6 name="capacity">Increase Server Capacity</h6>
            <p>
                In this release, the development team has significantly increased the
                base capacity of the web and database servers powering the Broker.
            </p>

            <h6 name="notifyauser">Notify Another User</h6>
            <p>
                Broker users can now send a notification to another user within their
                same agency when they want them to view a submission. This option is
                available on the Review Data page, after all validations have
                completed. You can also send other users in your agency the link to
                your in-progress submission anytime.
            </p>

            <h6 name="homepagesubmissiontable">
                Bugfix: Submissions Incorrectly Show as Valid
            </h6>
            <p>
                Several users reported a minor bug with the submission table that
                appears on the home page. It was showing submissions as valid that
                actually had errors. This has been corrected to more accurately
                reflect the status of a submission.
            </p>

            <h4>What&apos;s New in This Release - July 27, 2016</h4>
            <p>
                In this version of the Broker, we updated the Broker branding to Beta,
                improved the validation processing time, implemented short data
                element names, made the styling more consistent, improved the
                accessibility of the Broker, added a resources section, and updated
                the information on validations.

                We updated all the relevant text to reflect &ldquo;Beta Release.&rdquo; We still
                plan on incremental updates to the Broker about every two weeks.
            </p>

            <p>
                NOTE: Even though the DATA Act Broker - Beta Release has been in place
                since the June 29th release, the URL will remain the same

            <h6 name="processingTime">Validation Processing Time</h6>
            <p>
                We made some improvements to reduce the validation processing time. If
                you&apos;re still experiencing submissions that take more than 15-20
                minutes, please contact us so we can troubleshoot the issue.
            </p>

            <h6 name="shortNames">Short Data Element Names</h6>
            <p>
                Some agency financial systems need to use column heading that are less
                than 30 characters long. We have created a set of short element names.
                See the Resources section for element name crosswalk.

            <h6 name="consistentStyle">Consistent Broker Styling</h6>
            <p>
                We made some small changes so the Broker displays in a more consistent

            </p>

            <h6 name="validationSQL3">More Validations in SQL</h6>
            <p>
                Agency developers may be interested to know that we transitioned more
                of the Broker validations to using SQL statements. The list of SQL
                statements is publicly available on{" "}

            <h6 name="accessibilityImprovements">Accessibility Improvements</h6>
            <p>
                We made several changes to improve the accessibility of the Broker by
                adaptive technologies like screen readers. We also added an
                accessibility statement in this Help file.
            </p>

            <h4>What&apos;s New in This Release - July 13, 2016</h4>
            <p>
                NOTE: The DATA Act Broker - Alpha Release is now in beta status (as of
                the June 29, 2016 release). We will be updating the related text
                indicators on the website in the next release. The URL (
                <a href="https://alpha-broker.usaspending.gov">

                ) will not change for now.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this version of the Broker, we changed the submission date
                timeframe, reduced the errors generated by blanks, improved the
                display of the tree map for errors, display the cross file
                validations, and updated some more validations to SQL.

            <p>
                When you create a new submission, the date selection is for one month

            <h6 name="treeMap">Tree Map for Errors</h6>
            <p>
                We updated the color of the tree map and the language used to describe
                the errors. Look for further improvements to the error descriptions in
                future releases.
            </p>

            <p>
                After each individual file is validated, the Broker performs some
                cross-file validations. You will now see the results of these
                validations in the Broker, see a table of errors, be able to download
                an error report, and upload corrected files.
            </p>

            <h6 name="validationSQL2">More Validations in SQL</h6>

                In this version of the Broker, we made several small changes to make

                Agency developers may be interested to know that we transitioned some

            <h4>What&apos;s New in This Release - June 15, 2016</h4>
            <p>
                In this version of the Broker, we made it easier to select your
                agency, made it easier to submit your data without errors, and updated
                some of the validations.

                When you register for an account or create a submission, you can enter
                your CGAC code to correctly select your agency.
            </p>

            <h6 name="removeCommas">Accidental Commas in Dollar Amounts</h6>
            <p>
                The Practices and Procedures document specifies that dollar amounts
                should be submitted without commas. However, if you accidentally
                include commas in dollar amounts the Broker will remove them.
            </p>

            <h6 name="elementCaps">Header Row Capitalization Errors</h6>
            <p>
                The Practices and Procedures document specifies that the element names
                in the header row should exactly match the RSS element names. However,
                to assist you the Broker will process files with incorrect element
                name capitalization.

                functionality to help you select the reporting period, and updated

                Based on user feedback, the quarterly submission dates are displayed

            <h4>What&apos;s New in This Release - May 17, 2016</h4>
            <p>
                In this version of the Broker, we have made a change if you are
                logging in with Internet Explorer, added functionality for the Broker
                to recognize files with the pipe symbol as a delimiter, and updated
                some of the validations.

            <p>
                During user testing, some Internet Explorer users were unable to log
                into the Broker and upload files. We implemented a workaround so users
                with Internet Explorer on <strong>medium security settings</strong>{" "}
                can log in and upload files. See Known Issues below.

            <p>
                Based on user feedback, we changed the Broker to automatically detect
                whether a file is using a comma or pipe symbol as a delimiter, based
                on the format of the header row.

                Submitted files will be validated per RSS v1.0. Specifically:
                <em>Field names match the RSS v1.0</em>* Maximum field length does not
                exceed the value in RSS v1.0
                <em>Required fields are present per RSS v1.0</em>* Records in File C
                have a PIID, FAIN, or URI

            <p>
                We started work on cross file validations, beginning with cross

                and D2.
